###Objective
#You are going to write a program that calculates the average student height from a List of heights.
#mportant You should not use the sum() or len() functions in your answer. You should try to replicate their functionality using what you have learnt about for loops.
#Write your code below this row ğŸ‘‡
sum_of_heights = 0
index = 0

for heights in student_heights:
    index += 1
    sum_of_heights += heights

average_height = sum_of_heights / index

print(round(average_height))
