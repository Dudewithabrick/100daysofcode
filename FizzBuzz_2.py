#Write your code below this row ðŸ‘‡
'''
Instructions: 

    Your program should print each number from 1 to 100 in turn.

    When the number is divisible by 3 then instead of printing the number it should print "Fizz".

    When the number is divisible by 5, then instead of printing the number it should print "Buzz".`

      And if the number is divisible by both 3 and 5 e.g. 15 then instead of the number it should print "FizzBuzz"

for number in range (1, 101):
    answer = number
    if number % 3 == 0:
        answer = "Fizz"
    if number % 5 == 0 and number % 3 == 0:
            answer = "FizzBuzz"
    elif number % 5 == 0:
        answer = "Buzz"
    print(answer)
